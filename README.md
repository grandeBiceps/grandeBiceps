For the last 8 years I've been working for Telia. I have experience from different kinds of fields, like moderating and updating Telia's social media and other channels 
(Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Google Play, AppStore), writing blogs and articles, content creating, being a moderator on a forum (Telia YhteisÃ¶), 
customer service in social media channels, communications, being a stand in for supervisor during summer and I've also taken part in different kinds of projects. 
I was also involved in our recruitment process when we were hiring new colleagues to our social media team.
